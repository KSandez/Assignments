# What's the Weather like across the globe? Let's do a WeatherAPI Analysis!


Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..." 

But, if pressed, how would you prove it? 



In this example, using Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
1. Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
2. Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
3. Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
4. Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude


Final notebook should:
- Randomly select at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude.
- Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls. 
- Include a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number, city name, and requested URL.
- Save both a CSV of all data retrieved and png images for each scatter plot.

Final considerations:
- You must use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
- You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. 
- You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
- You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called  README.md in your GitHub repository.
